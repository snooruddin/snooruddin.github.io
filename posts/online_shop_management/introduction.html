                    <!-- write everything here -->
                    <p> I initially thought I would write some tutorials or cheat sheets for PL/SQL. I even started writing when I understood that there are just too many things to write about.</p>
                    <p> So I decided to do small projects with PL/SQL and explain the topics along the way. I also came to knew about SDLC like Waterfall model, Spiral model etc. I will try to follow the waterfall model for this project. I know the shortcomings of the waterfall project. But as this is a short personal project, the pitfalls won't matter much. </p>
                    <h4> Used Softwares </h4>
                    <p> I will use <a href="https://www.quest.com/toad/"> TOAD for Oracle </a> for PL/SQL purposes and VSCode for writing the data to files and Github for source control. You can use any software that you like for these purposes. A good alternative to toad is <span> Datagrip </span> by Jetbrains. Jetbrains products are very reliable and used by professionals all over the world. Jetbrains also provides free Licence for students and teachers. So, if you want, check them out. </p>
                    <p> TOAD for oracle is a very professional tool, but the interface is messy and it can easily confuse novice users. Datagrip on the other hand is also very professional and provides a lot of advanced features like auto-completion, super-fast recommendation system, great error detection system and much more. The only reason I am using TOAD for this project is because my university demands it and When I have to sit for a labtest, I have to use TOAD to perform the tasks asked. </p>
                    <h4> About The Project </h4>
                    <p> This Database system is for a online shop who has various products in its warehouse. This online shop has multiple customer care operators who permit the orders placed by registered customers and ship them to the customer addresses.<br> I understand that this project lacks one of the most important parts of a online shop management system : The Cart. But that is due to the constraints of the course requirements</p>
